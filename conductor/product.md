## Initial Concept

The Fractal Engine is a Real-World Asset (RWA) engine for the Dogecoin Blockchain. It runs alongside the Dogecoin L1, maintains its own side-chain, and allows users to fractionalize assets on the main Dogecoin Blockchain without bloating it.

## Primary Goal

The primary goal of the Fractal Engine is to enable the secure and efficient trading of fractionalized real-world assets for end-users.

## Target Audience

The engine serves a diverse audience, including:

- **Individual Investors & Collectors:** People who want to invest in or trade fractional ownership of real-world assets.
- **Businesses & Institutions:** Entities looking to tokenize their assets to increase liquidity and reach a broader market.

## Core Features

To serve its audience and achieve its primary goal, the engine must provide the following core functionality:

- **Secure Token Minting:** A robust and secure system for creating (minting) new tokens that represent fractional ownership of a real-world asset.
- **Token Marketplace:** A secure mechanism for users to buy and sell these asset-backed tokens.
