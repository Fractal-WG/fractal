This section covers practical, end-to-end flows for working with Fractal Engine. Start with minting a token, then follow the other guides as they are added.

## Common setup (code walkthrough)

1. Import the SDKs and helpers used throughout the flow.

   ```ts
   import { dogeToKoinu, signPayload } from "fractal-utils";
   import {
     CreateMintRequestPayload,
     FractalEngineRpcService,
   } from "fractal-engine-client-js";
   import km2, { Crypto, Net } from "@houseofdoge/km2";
   import { createClient } from "@connectrpc/connect";
   import { createConnectTransport } from "@connectrpc/connect-node";
   ```

   These provide the Fractal Engine client, Dogecoin transaction utilities, and signing helpers.

2. Configure constants for network, crypto, and API endpoint.

   ```ts
   const NETWORK = Net.Mainnet;
   const CRYPTO = Crypto.Dogecoin;
   const FRACTAL_ENGINE_URL = "http://localhost:8080";
   const SEED_PHRASE =
     "abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about";
   ```

   Replace the seed phrase with your wallet integration or a real mnemonic. Keep the URL in sync with your running Fractal Engine.

3. Generate a keypair from the seed phrase.

   ```ts
   function generateKeypair() {
     const seed = km2.SeedPhrase.from({
       mnemonic: SEED_PHRASE,
     });

     const wallet = new km2.Wallet(seed, {
       cryptocurrency: CRYPTO,
       network: NETWORK,
     });

     const kp = wallet.deriveKeypair({ account: 0, change: 0, index: 0 });

     return kp;
   }
   ```

   This derives the first account/change/index keypair for signing the mint payload and the on-chain transaction.

4. Create a Fractal Engine RPC client.

   ```ts
   function newClient() {
     const transport = createConnectTransport({
       baseUrl: FRACTAL_ENGINE_URL,
       httpVersion: "1.1",
     });

     return createClient(FractalEngineRpcService, transport);
   }
   ```

   The client sends RPC calls to the Fractal Engine service.
